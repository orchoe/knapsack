## Genetic Algorithm Way to Solve Knapsack Problem
### It is suitable for solving knapsack problems with large data.

### Original Question: 
Designing a competition allows the player to score as high as possible. 
There are N questions to choose from (1 <= N <= 10,000). 
You can choose any question or not to form the competition. 
Each question may requires different time and can get different score. 
The competition have to be finished in M minutes (1 <= M <= 10,000).

### The Input File
The two integers M, N in the first line respectively represent the limit time of the competition and the 
number of questions; the second to N+1 lines are two integers per line, 
respectively representing the score and time required for each such question.

The format of file just like this:  
300 4 \
100 60 \
250 120 \
120 100 \
35 20
